    The function first aligns the powerups among all DPMs, so each DPM has a full
    view of all previous power cycles. It may look something like:

        DPM1: [unknown, unknown, fault_1]
        DPM2: [fault_2, fault_3, fault_4]
        DPM3: [unknown, unknown, unknown]

    Notes:
      - Each column represents a power cycle experienced by the system.
      - "fault_x" indicates that the DPM realized a power fault cause on that powerup.
      - "unknown" indicates that a power fault cause cannot be realized by the DPM on
        that powerup. However, the power cycle has happened. It's either the DPM
        does not have the capability to detect the cause, or the DPM did not log anything.

    To determine the reboot cause for each powerup, we look at each column from top to bottom,
    and arbitrarily take the first known fault cause that we encounter. This works because HWs
    are generally designed to not log the same cause across DPMs. Except for CPUCARD-driven
    event where the SWITCHCARD also logs a record (as exampled in DPM2's fault_4).
    To handle this case, we place the CPUCARD's DPM before the SWITCHCARD's DPM in `pd-plugin.json`.

    For this example, we return `[fault_2, fault_3, fault_1]`.
